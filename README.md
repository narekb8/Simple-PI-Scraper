# Simple-PI-Scraper
### A simple Python script for web-scraping drug indications using their Prescribing Information

This script was initially built as a proof-of-concept for my internship at Trinity Life Sciences, but more accessible and easier to work with data sources were chosen over time, instead of blind scraping for the raw Prescribing Information of a given drug.

Nevertheless, the code does function properly. Unfortunately due to the inconsistency between PI formats and pdf file formatting itself, it is not too uncommon for the script to scrape the wrong text or to scrape waaaaay more than it should. As such, the script requires human overview once it is done running.

I eventually hope to improve the code by implementing OCR in the future.
